# FiberOMS Insight PWA - Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the FiberOMS Insight PWA project, following industry-standard practices for feature documentation and architectural decisions.

## Documentation Structure

### `/features/` - Feature Documentation

Individual feature documentation following a standardized template:

- **Purpose**: What the feature does and why it exists
- **User Experience**: How users interact with the feature
- **Technical Implementation**: Code architecture and key components
- **Dependencies**: External libraries and internal services used
- **Testing**: How the feature is tested
- **Maintenance**: Known issues and future improvements

### `/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records

Documents significant architectural decisions using the ADR format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The problem or situation driving the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications

### `/design/` - Design Documents

High-level design documents and specifications:

- System architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Data flow diagrams
- UI/UX design decisions

### `/implementation/` - Implementation Guides

Technical implementation details:

- Setup and configuration guides
- Code patterns and standards
- Integration guides
- Troubleshooting guides

## Documentation Standards

### Naming Convention

- Features: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
- ADRs: `YYYY-MM-DD-decision-title.md`
- Design docs: `system-name-design.md`
- Implementation: `topic-implementation.md`

### Template Usage

Each documentation type has a standardized template to ensure consistency and completeness.

### Maintenance

Documentation should be updated when:

- Features are modified or extended
- Architectural decisions are made or changed
- New implementation patterns are established
- Issues are discovered and resolved
